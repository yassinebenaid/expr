# expr

expr is a Golang package that provides facilities to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The syntax and operations are the same as in Go. 
Operands are the native float64 type, except that unlike in Go, boolean values, which are created by comparisons, are represented as integers 1 (true) and 0 (false).
